Theoretical Frameworks

Two key theories underpin this research:

Media Literacy Theory emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate media content. This theory provides a foundation for teaching individuals how to discern credible information from unreliable sources.
Cognitive Load Theory explores how individuals process information, emphasizing the need for simplified and accessible verification tools. High cognitive load often impairs decision-making, underscoring the importance of user-friendly verification mechanisms.
The Rise of Digital News

Digital platforms have become the primary source of news for many, particularly younger generations. Studies indicate that over 70% of Malaysian youth consume news via social media platforms. While these platforms offer convenience, they also serve as conduits for misinformation due to their algorithm-driven content delivery.

Misinformation and Its Impact

Misinformation is defined as false or inaccurate information spread unintentionally, while disinformation involves deliberate attempts to mislead. Both forms pose risks to democratic processes, public health, and social stability. In Malaysia, high-profile cases of misinformation have highlighted the urgent need for effective verification mechanisms.
The proliferation of digital news has transformed how information is disseminated and consumed globally. However, this rapid expansion has also led to a surge in misinformation and disinformation, posing significant challenges to authenticity verification. This paper examines the current landscape of digital news in Malaysia, focusing on youth engagement and strategies for fostering critical media literacy. By integrating theoretical frameworks with practical applications, the study proposes a comprehensive framework to educate and empower users to verify news authenticity.

INTRODUCTION
The digital revolution has significantly reshaped the media landscape, enabling instantaneous access to news and information. While these advancements have democratized information, they have also created opportunities for the spread of false and misleading content. This issue is particularly pertinent among youth, who are the largest consumers of digital news but often lack the skills to critically evaluate its authenticity. In the Malaysian context, where diverse cultures and languages intersect, the impact of misinformation can be profound, influencing public opinion and societal cohesion.

This paper explores the strategies for verifying the authenticity of digital news, emphasizing the role of education and technology in mitigating the spread of misinformation. The research focuses on three core objectives: understanding the challenges of digital news authenticity, evaluating existing verification strategies, and proposing a youth-centric framework for enhancing critical media literacy.
